My first shot, as a Ruby newbie (Rubie?  Nuby?):\n\n```ruby\ndef count_words(sentence)\n  occurences = {}\n  sentence.split(\" \").each do |word|\n    if occurences[word]\n      occurences[word] += 1\n    else\n      occurences[word] = 1\n    end\n  end\n  occurences\nend\n```\n\nAnd it worked.  But it felt bulky, like there must be a more concise way.  Looking over the spec file, I saw a comment which advised using ```Hash.new(0)``` rather than ```{}```.  There were two things I didn't understand.  1: that ```Hash.new``` and ```{}``` were different, and 2: that it looked like you could pass ```Hash.new``` an argument!\n\n### Hash.new(0)?\n\nGoogling \"Ruby Hash.new vs. braces\" led to [this blog post](http://www.developwithpurpose.com/ruby-hash-awesomeness-part-1/\n) elaborating on the differences between the two methods of hash construction.  Constructing as hash like this:\n```ruby\nhash = {\"a\" => 1, \"b\" => 2}\n```\nallows you to initialize the hash with data all on one line.  Whereas using ```Hash.new``` can only return an empty hash.  What ```Hash.new``` can do, though, is accept an argument.  As the author of that post points out, that argument is the default value for the hash, in place of ```nil```.  For example:\n\n```ruby\nhash_1 = {}          # Empty hash\nhash_1[:a]           # nil\n\nhash_2 = Hash.new(0) # Empty hash\nhash_2[:a]           # 0\n```\n\nThis was perfect!  If I could set the default value for my ```occurences``` hash to 0, I could eliminate most of the code in my each block, reducing it to:\n```ruby\n  sentence.split(\" \").each do |word|\n    occurences[word] += 1\n  end\n```\n\nThis works because ```occurences[word] += 1``` really means ```occurences[word] = occurences[word] + 1```. As the default value of ```occurences``` is 0, whenever a new word is found, ```occurences[word]``` is set to 0 + 1.  The tests pass, and I'm satisfied.  On to the next one.\n\n### Hash.new([]): humbled again\n\nNext problem: organize a list of songs, in the format of an \"Artist - Song\" String, into a hash of this format: artist => array of songs.  With my newfound knowledge of default Hash values, I jumped in like this:\n\n```ruby\ndef organize_songs_by_artist(songs)\n  songs_by_artist = Hash.new([])\n  songs.each do |song|\n    artist, song_name = song.split(\" - \")\n    songs_by_artist[artist] << song_name\n  end\n  songs_by_artist\nend\n```\n\nWith an empty array as the default Hash value, this should work just like the previous question!  Right?\n\nWell no, of course it didn't.  I was returned an empty hash.  I look back over my code, and try some quick tests in irb, to no avail.  Puzzled, I throw myself once again upon the mercy of Google.\n\nAs often happens, I found a [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2552579/ruby-method-array-not-updating-the-array-in-hash) from somehow having a very similar problem.  They're using yet another method of initializing a Hash, using a block:\n\n```ruby\n  h = Hash.new{Array.new}\n```\n\nI didn't know you could do that, but looking at the [Hash documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Hash.html#method-c-new) explains that this method will cause the block to execute and return a default value.  That's pretty neat, but the same problem is present.  It looks like nothing shoveled onto the default empty array is saved.\n\n[The top answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2552946/3536464) does an excellent job of explaining this confusing behavior.\n\nI don't think I fully understand it, but what I got from this answer is that when I call ```songs_by_artist[artist] << song_name``` for an artist that is not yet in the hash, it evaluates to this: ```[] << song_name```.  So the value DOES get shoveled to an array, but since there is nothing that points to that array, it gets garbage collected.  The solution is to initialize my hash with a block that will, as a default, explicitly assign an empty array to the non-existant key.  That is, instead of initializing my hash with this:\n\n```ruby\n songs_by_artist = Hash.new([])\n```\n\n , I could do this:\n\n ```ruby\n   songs_by_artist = Hash.new{|hash, key| hash[key] = []}\n```\n\nSo when ```songs_by_artist[artist] << song_name``` executes for a non-existant artist, the hash will create an empty array, assign it as the value of ```songs_by_artist[artist]```, and then shovel ```song_name``` onto that array.\n\nMy final code, which passes:\n\n```ruby\n\n```",
