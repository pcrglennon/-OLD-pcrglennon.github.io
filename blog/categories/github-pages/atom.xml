    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m building a small Backbone todo-list app (because there will never be enough of those!) as a learning exercise.  And I was running into difficulties when I started using the RequireJS text plugin; my browser was complaining about <code>Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP</code> when running totally locally.  Looking into it, I discovered I needed to run on a local server, so I could serve everything over HTTP.  A friend had been telling me about hosting on github-pages, but I already had this blog app running on my gitub-hosted site.  Could I host the todo app as a sub-page on my site?</p>

<h3>Github&rsquo;s Project Pages</h3>

<p>Well, figuring out how to host multiple repos on a Github Pages site was absurdly easy.  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually">Here&rsquo;s a link to the official Github documentaion</a>.  Those instructions are geared to hosting a simple static information site, but you can also use project pages to host an HTML/CSS/JS only application.  All you need to do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ensure you have an <code>index.html</code> page in your root directory</li>
<li>Create an orphan branch named gh-pages: <code>git checkout --orphan gh-pages</code></li>
<li><code>git push origin gh-pages</code></li>
</ul>


<p>And now, the contents of <code>index.html</code> will be available on <code>[your-github-site]/[repo-name]</code>.  It can take a while to register the changes.  The docs say up to 15 minutes, but for me it&rsquo;s usually done in less than a minute.</p>

<h3>Running as a local server</h3>

<p>So that deployed the app to the Github Pages app, but I still need a local server for development.  Fortunately, if you use Ruby, it&rsquo;s simple!  All you need is to setup a Gemfile, add <code>gem 'github-pages'</code>, <code>bundle install</code>, and finally <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code>.  Now there&rsquo;s a basic local server running at localhost:4000.  I&rsquo;m sure this could get a lot more complicated, but that&rsquo;s all I need right now.</p>
